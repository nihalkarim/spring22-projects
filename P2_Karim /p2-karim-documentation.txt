Assignment:
Project 2 â€“ April 18, 2022

Description:
This project uses CDC demographic and health data and visualizes it on the canvas.
Users can visualize specific health + demographic data for different population sets.
Users may also choose to see county names and scale the visualization.

User responsibilities:
The user needs to select different optionss through the DOM elements.
They may choose from 4 different population sets:
    - All localities
    - Population <150k
    - Population >150k
    - >30% of population is NOT white
The user may also choose from 4 different visualization mapping options
    - Map depression, <7hrs of sleep, and median income
    - Map no health insurance, whiteness, annual checkup, and diabetes
    - Map current smoking and asthma
    - Map obesity, high cholesterol, and heart disease

Caveats/known issues:
    - I made a different legend for each of the 4 mapping options. However, I'm having trouble loading any of the images, so there's no legend for now :(
    - I didn't have time to do the scaling, so the control doesn't do anything at the moment

Notes
    - There are a couple requirements (legend + scaling) that are incomplete, but I'm going to try to get them done asap.
